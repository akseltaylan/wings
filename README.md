Art Directable Feather Simulation

Tool that will eventually allow for procedural generation and grooming on feathers for characters in Houdini, and simulate physically based motion of the feathers through a C++ backend.

Currently the project supports the following features:
- Generation of feather primitives
- Physically based motion of feathers through C++ simulation
- Art-directable controls within the HDA interface
